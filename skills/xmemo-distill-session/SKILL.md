# Distill a session

1. Extract candidate decisions, stable context, reusable lessons, concrete TODOs, unresolved choices, and working state.
2. Exclude filler, raw transcript text, secrets, hidden reasoning, duplication, and tentative claims.
3. Search for overlapping memories before creating duplicates.
4. Preview judgment-heavy candidates and distinguish approved outcomes from proposals.
5. Route each approved item:
   - new durable concept → `remember`
   - revision → `update_memory`
   - concrete action → `create_memory_todo`
   - replaceable progress → `update_state`
   - significant milestone → `record_event`
6. Return a receipt listing saved, updated, skipped, and still-unresolved items.
